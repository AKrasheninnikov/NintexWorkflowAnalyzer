# NintexWorkflowAnalyzer
Since the Nintex Workflow Analyzer stopped working in Codeplex, I have recompiled the project and also copied over to github.

You can use the binary directly in the release.

The NuGet packages that are pre-requisites for this project are:<br/>
- Xceed.Products.Wpf.DataGrid.Full
- jacobslusser.ScintillaNET


# Installation
Extract the zip file into a folder.

Double click on the WorkflowAnalyzer.application and install it.

Create a shortcut in your desktop or wherever you wish for this application, the shortcut is for the WorkflowAnalyzer.application
